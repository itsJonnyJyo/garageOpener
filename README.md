# (1/14/2016) The python script using rpi.gpio does not currently work. I have tested the pins with a multimeter and everthing appears
# to be in order but the relay will not actuate. I have resorted to using a shell script which I hope will not cause problems with the
# future webpage.

An application for a raspberry pi that will use the gpio pins to activate a relay switch which is wired to my garage door.
When the relay closes the circuit, the garage door activates.
